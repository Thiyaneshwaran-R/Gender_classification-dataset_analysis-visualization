# Gender Classification Dataset â€“ Data Analysis & Visualization

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a Gender Classification dataset using Python and Pandas.  
The goal is to understand the datasetâ€™s structure, detect outliers, and visualize key patterns through various charts.

## ðŸ›  Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Loaded the dataset into Jupyter Notebook.
   - Checked dataset info, shape, column names, and data types.
   - Used `.iloc` and `.loc` to view specific rows and columns.
   - Verified there were **no null values**.

2. **Data Exploration**
   - Used `.describe()` to view summary statistics.
   - Checked for outliers in numerical columns.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Created multiple charts to understand data distribution and relationships:
     - Histogram
     - Boxplot
     - Bar Chart
     - Scatter Plot
     - Line Graph
     - Pie Chart

## ðŸ“Š Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** â€“ Data loading, cleaning, and exploration
- **Matplotlib** â€“ Visualization
- **Seaborn** â€“ Visualization

  ## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Dataset contains no missing values.
- No outliers were detected and visualized using boxplots.
- Various charts helped in understanding feature distributions and relationships.
